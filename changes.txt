  -parser: confirmed data: fixed parsing of HGNC and EnsEMBL fields -- per RGDD-1261

ver 1.0.0, Aug 16, 2016
  -statLoader: first working version deployed

ver 1.0.10, Aug 12, 2016
  -QC: updated rgdcore.jar, which had updated equality comparison code: 'energy' field is no longer
    being used in comparisons, because 'energy' field is no longer present in the incoming data;
    this should 1) preserve the existing historical energy values
                2)prevent dropping and reloading all of the data we have in MIRNA_TARGETS table
  -statsLoader: very preliminary code

ver 1.0.9, Aug 11, 2016
  -DL: stale data handling: 5% threshold to trigger stale data deletion could be configured
    in the app properties file

ver 1.0.8, Aug 8, 2016
  -parser: predicted data: allowed handling of data with missing 'energy','id','score','normalized_score' fields
    (previously that fields were mandatory)
  -QC: stale data handling: enforced a rule that prevents deleting any data
    if more than 5% of data is subject to deletion

ver 1.0.7, Sep 23, 2015
  -optimized QC processing by better utilizing the available cores
  -greatly optimized code reducing total running time from 3 days to few hours

ver 1.0.6, July 1, 2015
  -greatly improved robustness when handling unparsable files (f.e. partially downloaded)

  -when processing zero length files, an attempt is always made to download them
   (previously the file was attempted to be loaded only once per quarter)
